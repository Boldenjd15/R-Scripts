#Forecasting Methods HW#2 Question 3.10
#Jeremy Bolden
#Due Date: 10/23/19
#
#Question 3.10) This exercise uses the canadian_gas data (monthly Canadian gas production in billions of cubic metres, January
# 1960 â€“ February 2005).
#
#A) Plot the data using autoplot(), gg_subseries() and gg_season() to look at the effect of the changing seasonality
# over time. What do you think is causing it to change so much?
#
#B) Do an STL decomposition of the data. You will need to choose a seasonal window to allow for the changing shape of
# the seasonal component.
#
#C) How does the seasonal shape change over time? [Hint: Try plotting the seasonal component using gg_season().]
#
#D) Can you produce a plausible seasonally adjusted series?
#
#E)Compare the results with those obtained using SEATS and X11. How are they different?

#Answer - I believe that the production in gas in Canada fluctuates more based on the tempertaure/weather. During the
#warmer summer months, people are less likely to be heating their homes with gas and it's also offset by increased traveling.
#As you get closer to the end of the year, you begin to see a general rise again as the colder temperatures begin to close in. #Answer

# Smaller .size or "window" values allow for more rapid changes in the plot. The higher the numbers, the less of a
# movement in the trend line. BOTH TREND AND SEASONAL WINDOWS SHOULD BE ODD NUMBER (according to the textbook)!!!
# Trend window is # the number of consecutive observations to be used when estimating the trend-cycle; season window
# is the number of # consecutive years to be used in estimating each value in the seasonal component. Setting the
# seasonal window to be # infinite is equivalent to forcing the seasonal component to be periodic
# season(window='periodic')(i.e., identical # across years). This results in a nearly uniform seaonality across the
# plot. When adjusting for a smaller sample size of the data, we do not have to change the window size as much Answer

#
# Answer - The plot shows us that between late 1970s and early 1990s, there was a greater variation in the amount of
# gas being produced during the higher and lower peaks and troughs of the year, with not much change in frequency.
# Around the mid 90s, we begin to see a slighly more consistent production variation, however the frequency of change in
# the inflection points on the graph increases significantly. This could easily mean that the production cycle is more
# closely in line with meeting the proper amount of demand for fuel consumption and not over or under producing fuel. #Answer

#The differeces are very minor when seeing the components from SEASTS and X11. We can see a slightly less linear
#increase with the trend line. There appears to be some of the residuals bleeding into the trend or seasonal portion of
#the decomp. That's not necessary a bad thing as we do not want to run into over-fitting of the model.
